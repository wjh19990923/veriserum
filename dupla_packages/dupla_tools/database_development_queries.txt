Just some thoughts on SQL queries for the DUPLA database


# Calibration
Let's say we have a measurement "meas_id" that we want to find the calibrations for

SELECT sic.* 
FROM source_int_calibration as sic
INNER JOIN 
calibration_trials as ct
ON sic.calibration_trial_id = ct.id
INNER JOIN
measurements as m
ON m.trials_id = ct.trials_id
WHERE m.id = meas_id

# Pose
We are looking at a specific measurement and have one anatomy (which is saved)
SELECT poses.*
FROM poses
INNER JOIN 
measurements as m
ON poses.measurement_id = m.id
WHERE poses.measurement_id = meas_id 
AND poses.anatomy_id = anat_id
ORDER BY datetime DESC

# get anatomy path by its id
SELECT trials.data_path, anatomies.path
FROM anatomies
INNER JOIN
subjects ON anatomies.id = subjects.id
INNER JOIN
trials ON subjects.trials_id = trials.id
INNER JOIN
studies ON trials.study_id = studies.id
WHERE anatomies.id = %(anatomies_id)i
